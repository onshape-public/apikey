# Python API Key Sample

OnShapepy

Python package to use the OnShape API. Based on apikey by Ty-Lucas Kelley.

This README is out of date....

- Can use Python 3+
- Can keep credentials in any file (pass in creds filename)

---

### Local Setup

Install the dependencies:

* Python 2 (2.7.9+). Python 3.5+ is better!
* pip
* note: it's best to do all of this in a virtual env. See pipenv for the latest...

You can now install the needed Python packages:

```sh
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create a `creds.json` file in the root project directory, with the following format:

```json
{
    "https://cad.onshape.com": {
        "access_key": "ACCESS KEY",
        "secret_key": "SECRET KEY"
    }
}
```

Just replace "ACCESS KEY" and "SECRET KEY" with the values you got from the
developer portal. To test on other stacks, you'll create another object in the file,
with credentials for that specific stack.

To run the basic application:

```sh
$ python onshape_util.py
```

The old basic app

```sh
$ python app.py
```

To print an STL representation of a given part studio to the console:

```sh
$ python exportstl.py
```

If you want to specify a different stack to test on, simply go into the file you're running and
change the `stack` parameter on this line:

```py
c = ClientExtended(stack='https://cad.onshape.com', creds='path/to/creds.json')
```
